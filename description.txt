How contributing on open source project ?

You have to Fork a repo on your profil with "Fork"

When you fork it you have to clone it on your Git

Read README.md for know how contribute on this project

Make your new branch

1. git checkout -b "my-new-feature"

Make your commits
2. git commit -m "Added feature allowing users to comment on the blog articles"

Send your modifications on GitHub
3. git push origin "my-new-feature"

WARNING !

Don't do "git push origin master": this is not your principal branch !
You have to put your new branch "my-new-feature" than you want to send on GitHub

Exemple : My new branch as named "readme-update", for send my modifications on Github i'll made"git push origin readme-update", not "git push origin "master"

Good luck ! :)
